# Tech part

This chat app uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* React
* Express
* nodeJS
* Material-ui by google
* Socket.IO
* react-scroll-to-bottom

And of course this app itself is open source with a public repository http://github.com/LasCC/chat-app available on GitHub.

### Installation

Chat app use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run but for my purpose I put the app on Heroku, you just need to change the endpoint with your own back-end url. 
(The endpoint is located in : front/src/components/Party.js:15)

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd front
$ npm i 
$ npm start
```

```sh
$ cd back
$ npm i 
$ npm start
```

### Todos

 - Change the interface
 - Add Dark mode
